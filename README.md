    Achtung, die Kurve!

Long before microservices, before WebSockets, before Docker containers dutifully spun in the background, there was a simple idea:

> *"What if turning left or right was enough to ruin a friendship?"*

The Curve traces its origins to early multiplayer arcade experiences — most notably the browser classic Achtung, die Kurve! — a game defined by minimal mechanics and emergent complexity. Each player moves continuously, leaving a persistent trail behind. The objective is straightforward: survive by avoiding collisions with walls, opponents, and most critically, oneself.

From this minimal rule set emerges strategic depth. Movement is deterministic. Space is finite. Every decision reshapes the arena in real time. Success depends not on randomness, but on anticipation, spatial reasoning, and controlled execution.

This project presents a modern, web-based interpretation of that classic concept. Built using a service-oriented architecture and real-time communication protocols, it preserves the elegance of the original while introducing persistent user management, rating systems, and synchronized multiplayer gameplay. Its purpose is educational: to apply advanced full-stack web engineering principles in a collaborative environment, transforming a simple game concept into a scalable, real-time distributed system.

*Every match is a study in controlled chaos.<br/>
Every gap is either mercy or trap. <br/>
There is no randomness in failure. Only geometry.*

Welcome to *Achtung, die Kurve!*, — reimagined for the modern web.

    If you do not have the encryption key, create the `.env` files manually from the provided examples and fill in the required values (DB credentials, API keys, etc.).

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then build and start the application:

    ```bash
    make deps
    make up
    ```

    <br/>


2.  **Common Commands**

    ```bash
    make down        # Stop services
    make re          # Rebuild (preserves data)
    make reset       # Full rebuild (removes volumes)
    make health      # Show service health
    make logs        # View logs
    ```
    <br/>

# Team Information & Project Management

## Communication & Project Management

Our team followed the `Scrum Agile` process for structured collaboration. We worked closely in person every **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** with a one week sprint cycle. Each Tuesday began with a sprint planning session, during which we defined the goals for the week, distributed tasks, and clarified technical decisions. On Thursday, we held a sprint review to evaluate completed work, test integrations across services, and identify improvements for the next sprint.

Task planning and tracking were managed using **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Milestones**, where features and bugs were tagged using labels like `feature`, `bug`, `blocking`, `docs` and `wontfix`. This allowed us to prioritise work and track progress.

For daily communication and quick coordination, we used **Slack**. This allowed us to discuss important details, share debugging insights and quickly resolve blockers. If a team member could not attend an important work session, we used **Google Meet** for video calling.

<br/>

# Technical Stack

This section outlines the technologies and architectural choices used in the project, along with the reasoning behind each selection.

<br/>

<h3 align="center">
    Diagram showing platform architecture
</h3>

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/Architecture Diagram.drawio.png" alt="The Curve Animation" width="1080"/>
</p>

<br/>


## Frontend

**`Svelte / SvelteKit`**

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. With SvelteKit adding a layer on top of Svelte for full-stack application framework support.

- Fast UI for real-time games. Svelte compiles to compact JavaScript with minimal runtime overhead, suitable for frequent UI updates (e.g. Player State at 30Hz).

- Store-driven state management. Svelte stores map cleanly to a state-driven architecture: derived state, reactive updates, and subscriptions make syncing UI to `wsStore` straightforward.

- Full app framework. Routing, layouts, server endpoints, and deployment conventions are built-in, allowing for pages like `lobby/:id`, `game/:id`, authentication flows, etc.

<br/>


## Backend

### API and Auth

**`Laravel (PHP)`**

Laravel is a PHP framework following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for API development.

- Strong authentication. Laravel provides secure password hashing, authentication, middleware guards, and session management.

- Object-relational mapping. ORM makes relationships (users, games, match history) easy to define and maintain.

<br/>


### Database

**`MariaDB`**

MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

- Reliable relational data model. MariaDB is will suited to structured data such as users, games, match history.

- High performance under concurrency. Handles multiple simultaneous reads/writes efficiently, important for active lobbies and game sessions.

<br/>


### Game Engine

**`Collision Detection`**

A self-written collision detection system designed specifically for a deterministic, state-machine–driven multiplayer game engine. See the game-engine docs: [Game-Engine README](services/game-service/README.md)


- Minimising complexity of player collision detection. A broad-phase uses a spatial grid to minimise potential collision candidates, and DDA grid traversal to find nearby player segments. A narrow-phase performs exact distance checks on minimal candidates. Minimising complexity is necessary for the `state-machine`-like game engine.

<br/>


**`OpenSkill`**

Openskill is based on TrueSkill, a Bayesian skill rating algorithm originally developed by Microsoft for competitive multiplayer games (e.g., Xbox Live).

- Fair and balanced ranking progression. OpenSkill accounts for uncertainty of new players and prevents large swings in single matches, resulting in more consistent rewards for players in multiplayer games.

    - index on `(user_id, game_id)`
- **Key fields:**
    - `rank` (int, nullable) — finishing placement (you can document: `1 = winner`, 2..n = placement)
    - `diff` (double, nullable) — rating delta for this game (if you store it)
    - `rating_mu`, `rating_sigma` (double, nullable) — snapshot at time of game (or post-game; document which)
    - `rating` (decimal, computed) = `rating_mu - 3*rating_sigma`

### Development Tools & AI Assistance

During development we used several AI-assisted tools as supplementary resources.  
**GitHub Copilot** was used primarily for code suggestions and lightweight code reviews during implementation.

**ChatGPT** and **Claude** were occasionally consulted for conceptual guidance, debugging ideas, documentation suggestions, and general software engineering questions (e.g., architectural considerations, algorithm explanations, and formatting improvements for documentation).

All generated suggestions were reviewed, tested, and adapted by the team before being incorporated into the project. No AI-generated code was included without verification and integration with the project’s architecture and coding standards.
